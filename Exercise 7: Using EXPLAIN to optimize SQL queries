ans 2.1
It means total no. of rows present in table and the number of rows mysql is traversing to find the ans is same.
ans 2.2
Select query is not optimal.we need to add index on user_id coloumn.
ans 3.1
first i will index user_id coloumn then i will index commentable_type coloumn
ans 4.1
explainusing join
id select_type table type possible_keys key key_len  ref             rows Extra
1   SIMPLE      A   ALL      NULL      NULL   NULL   NULL             4
1   SIMPLE      C   ref      A_id      A_id   1022   Articles.A.A_id  1   Using where

id 1 means there is only one query
select type simple means no subquery or union has been used 
table means alias used by the query
type - all meansquery will scan all the records
possible keys-The optional indexes MySQL can choose from, to look up for rows in the table
key-This column indicates the actual index MySQL decided to use.
key_len-It indicates the length of the key that MySQL decided to use, in bytes.
rows-Indicates the amount of number of rows MySQL believes it must examine from this table, to execute the query. 
extra-Contains more information about the query processing

explain using subquery

id select_type  table    type possible_keys   key     key_len     ref             rows  Extra
1   Primary    Article   ALL       NULL      NULL     NULL       NULL             4
1   Primary    Commentid ref       A_id      A_id     1022    Articles.A.A_id     1     Using where; FirstMatch(Article)

the performance of both queries are same since number of rows that will be traversed is same in both the queries on changes are select
type and table coloumn and extra coloumn
